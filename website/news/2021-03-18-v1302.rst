=================
ELBE 13.2 release
=================


Debian packages for “ELBE 13.2” are available from linutronix. Add
something like this to your sources.list:

::

   deb http://debian.linutronix.de/elbe buster main

Elbe test consolidation
=======================

``elbe test`` is improved, with armhf and arm64 tests. subtests and
error report collection works properly now.

SDK for amd64 does not crash anymore
====================================

Non-cross SDK’s did not work properly.

HD image generation
===================

Partitions with binary contents and setting of arbitrary partition types
is now supported. This allows Xilinx bootloaders for example.

Arm64 validate bug fixed
========================

Validation of arm64 projects always failed. This is fixed and arm64
works fine now.

Source cdrom split
==================

This elbe version now builds more than one Source CDROM. It builds:

-  ``src-cdrom-target.iso``
-  ``src-cdrom-main.iso``
-  ``src-cdrom-added.iso``

This scheme might get some changes in the future. But the isolation of
the target cdrom will remain.
