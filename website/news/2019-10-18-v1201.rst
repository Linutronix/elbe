Processing License Files
========================

Fixed a bug in the license file processing which end up in a build
failure is fixed.

========

If a pbuilder builded a broken package, the error was persisted in the
logging queue, and it was never reseted. This bug is fixed in version
12.1.

examples

The example x86_64-pc-hdimg-gnome3.xml is working again.
