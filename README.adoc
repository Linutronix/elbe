ELBE
====

http://elbe-rfs.org

ELBE is the 'E.mbedded L.inux B.uild E.nvironment'.
It can be used to build embedded Linux Rootfilesystems based on Debian packages.

ELBE runs on Debian Linux Host Systems.


Software Dependencies
---------------------
If using ELBE from git repository directly, you'll need following packages installed:

    apt install python python-debian python-mako python-lxml python-apt python-gpg python-suds python-libvirt qemu-utils qemu-kvm p7zip-full make


Crash Course
------------
1. use a Elbe XML file (e.g. from /usr/share/doc/elbe/examples or
   examples/ in the elbe source tree)

2. run "./elbe initvm create ./examples/armhf-ti-beaglebone-black.xml

   * This command creates an initvm directory in the current working directory,
   * installs and starts a virtual buildenvironemnt
   * within this build environment the beaglebone-black image will be built
   * after the build finished the build results will be copied into
        elbe-build-<TIMESTAMP>

3. copy the rfs to a sdcard: 'sudo dd if=elbe-build*/sdcard.img of=/dev/mmcblk0'

License rules
-------------
ELBE is provided under the terms of the GPLv3+ license as provided in the
COPYING file.

Instead of adding GPLv3+ boilerplates to the individual files, elbe uses SPDX
license identifiers, which are machine parseable and considered legaly
equivalent.

File headers
------------
ELBE files start with a common file header:

----
# <PATH TO INTERPRETER> (optional)
# <SOME TEXT>           (optional)
# <COPYRIGHT>           (optional)
# <SPDX TAG>
----

`#` can be replaced by a comment operator for another programming language, e.g.
/* <...> */ or // <...> is also allowed.

Empty comment lines are allowed in the header. A single header section like
<SOME TEXT> can use multiple lines.

The SPDX TAG needs to be the last entry in the header.
