ELBE
====

http://elbe-rfs.org

ELBE is the 'E.mbedded L.inux B.uild E.nvironment'.
It can be used to build embedded Linux Rootfilesystems based on Debian packages.

ELBE runs on Debian Linux Host Systems.


Software Dependencies
---------------------
If using ELBE from git repository directly, you'll need following packages installed:

    apt install python3 python3-debian python3-mako python3-lxml python3-apt \
        python3-gpg python3-suds python3-libvirt qemu-utils qemu-kvm p7zip-full \
        make python3-passlib libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-system debian-archive-keyring


Crash Course
------------
1. use an Elbe XML file (e.g. from /usr/share/doc/elbe/examples or
   examples/ in the elbe source tree)

2. run "./elbe initvm create ./examples/armhf-ti-beaglebone-black.xml

   * This command creates an initvm directory in the current working directory,
   * installs and starts a virtual buildenvironemnt
   * within this build environment the beaglebone-black image will be built
   * after the build finished the build results will be copied into
        elbe-build-<TIMESTAMP>

3. copy the rfs to a sdcard: 'sudo dd if=elbe-build*/sdcard.img of=/dev/mmcblk0'

Report bugs or any other feedback
---------------------------------
Before reporting a new bug, please note that the bug needs to be validated with
respect to the latest version of elbe.
Please use the issue tracker on GitHub. When reporting an issue, please provide
the following information.

* Reproducing steps. In the best case, having an xml file would be good.
* In case the build failed, please give the exact error message or the log file.
* If the error message is not helpful, please give the expected message with a
  valid explanation.

License rules
-------------
ELBE is provided under the terms of the GPLv3+ license as provided in the
COPYING file.

Instead of adding GPLv3+ boilerplates to the individual files, elbe uses SPDX
license identifiers, which are machine parseable and considered legaly
equivalent.

File headers
------------
ELBE files start with a common file header:

----
# <PATH TO INTERPRETER> (optional)
# <SOME TEXT>           (optional)
# <COPYRIGHT>           (optional)
# <SPDX TAG>
----

`#` can be replaced by a comment operator for another programming language, e.g.
/* <...> */ or // <...> is also allowed.

Empty comment lines are allowed in the header. A single header section like
<SOME TEXT> can use multiple lines.

The SPDX TAG needs to be the last entry in the header.
