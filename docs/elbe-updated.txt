NAME
----
elbe-updated - Elbe update daemon.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'elbe updated' \
	[ --directory <update_dir> ] \
	[ --host <host> ] \
	[ --nosign ] \
	[ --port <port> ]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
'elbe updated' is the Elbe update daemon, which runs on the target system. It
watches a directory for incoming update packages (which have been created with
linkgit:elbe-gen_update[1] in the build VM) and applies them to the system. By
default, only signed update packages are allowed. To sign an update package,
please use linkgit:elbe-sign[1].

'elbe updated' also has a built in SOAP interface which can be used to monitor
the status of the update daemon and to initiate downgrades.

This command has to be run as root *on the target system*. Please note that
'elbe updated' is usually started by the init script of its package, so in most
cases there should be no need to start it by invoking this command directly.


OPTIONS
-------
--directory <update_dir>::
	Monitor the given directory for incoming update packages. Default is:
	'/var/cache/elbe/updates'

--host <host>::
	Bind address for the SOAP interface. Default is to bind to all network
	interfaces.

--nosign::
	Accept update packages without signatures.

--port <port>::
	Port for the SOAP interface. Default is 8088.


EXAMPLES
--------
* Start the update daemon, watch '/updates' for updates and accept update
packages without a signature.
