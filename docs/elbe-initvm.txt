              Allows to create an initvm and directly build Rootfilesystems using ELBE.

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This command allows to build and manage an initvm.

Initvms are managed via libvirt, and its necessary, that a user is a member of the
libvirt group.


OPTIONS
-------

--directory <dir>::
	Directory where the initvm resides, or is supposed to reside.
	(Defaults to './build')

--skip-download::
	After the build has finished, the generated Files are downloaded from
	the initvm to the host. This step is skipped, when this option is specified.

--output <dir>::
	Directoryname where the generated and downloaded Files should be saved.
	The default is to generate a directory with a timestamp in the current working
	directory.

--user <username>::
	Username to use for login (defaults to root).

--pass <password>::
	Password for login (defaults to 'foo').

--retries <N>::
	How many times to retry the connection to the server before giving up
	(default is 10 times, yielding 10 seconds).

--skip-build-bin::
	Skip building binary repository CDROM, for exact reproduction.

--skip-build-sources::
	Skip building source CDROM.
	
--output <directory>::
	Output downloaded files to <directory>.

--keep-files::
	don't delete elbe project files after a build in the initvm
	use 'elbe control list_projects' to get a list of available projects

COMMANDS
--------

'attach'::

Attach to the initvm console, which is accessed via virsh.


'create' [ <xmlfile> | <isoimage> ]::

This command triggers a complete rebuild of the Elbe XML File.
it also includes rebuilding the initvm.
+
If an initvm is already available, you should use the 'submit' command,
to build a project in an existing initvm.
+
Note that only a single initvm can be running on your host.
+
When a iso Image with the binaries has been built earlier, it can also
be used to recreate the original image. The source.xml from the iso will
be used, and all the binary packages available also.


'submit' [ <xmlfile> | <isoimage> ]::

This command triggers a complete rebuild of the Elbe XML File.
It will however use an existing initvm.
+
When a iso Image with the binaries has been built earlier, it can also
be used to recreate the original image. The source.xml from the iso will
be used, and all the binary packages available also.


'start'::

Start initvm in the Background.


'stop'::

Shutdown running initvm.


'ensure'::

Make sure an initvm is running in the Background.


Examples
--------

* Build an initvm and on that build an elbe example:
+
------------
$ elbe initvm create /usr/share/doc/elbe-doc/examples/rescue.xml
------------

* Reuse the initvm built in the previous Step to build another example xml
+
------------
$ elbe initvm submit /usr/share/doc/elbe-doc/examples/elbe-desktop.xml
