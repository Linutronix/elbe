elbe v0.9.8 (2015-12-14)
========================


The ‘big’ news in this release include:

-  an USB Monitor for updated

-  elbe chg_archive takes a directory OR a .tar.gz file as input

-  pbuilder support to rebuild debian packages

Howto use the pbuilder feature:

::

   # build an initvm with the current elbe version 0.9.8
   $ elbe initvm create
   # retrieve the source of a debian package you'd like to rebuild
   $ apt-get source nano
   # go to the source directory
   $ cd nano-2.4.2
   # we currently only support debian source format git and native
   $ echo "3.0 (native)" > debian/source/format
   # if wanted, the source or debian/ files can be modified now
   $ vi src/nano.c
   # increase the package version
   $ dch
   # use any ELBE XML file to..
   $ zcat /usr/share/doc/elbe-doc/examples/armhf-ti-beaglebone-black.xml.gz > /tmp/bbb.xml
   # ..rebuild the package against
   $ elbe pbuilder build --xmlfile /tmp/bbb.xml
