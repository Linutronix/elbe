==============

NAME
----
elbe-setsel - Replace the package list of an Elbe XML file by a list obtained
from 'dpkg-getselections'.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'elbe setsel' <xmlfile> <pkglist>


DESCRIPTION
-----------
'elbe setsel' replaces the package list of an Elbe XML file by a package list
obtained from 'dpkg --get-selections'. Together with the setsel mode of Elbe,
this offers a more fine-grained control on which packages are installed (even
apt and aptitude can be excluded from the root filesystem). The recommended
usage is as follows:

. Generate an image using the default mode of Elbe.
. Run the image and use 'apt-get' to purge unwanted packages.
. Maybe even use 'dpkg' to remove apt and aptitude.
. Generate the list of selected packages using
  'dpkg --get-selections > selections.list'
. Transfer this file to the host system.
. Use 'elbe setsel <xmlfile> selections.list' to import the package list into
  the XML file.
. Rebuild using the setsel mode of Elbe.

OPTIONS

<xmlfile>::
