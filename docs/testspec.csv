ELBE TestSpec,,,,
,,,,
#,Component,Functional Requirement,Test,Expectation
1,debianization,Debian binary and source packages,build packages with pbuilder,"same number of binary packages as in previous test, one source package"
2,,Debian Repository,build Debian repository with reprepro or aptly,Repo including all necessary packages
3,initvm create,build an initvm image,use absolute path for –directory,Makefile and buildenv.img at specified path
4,,,use relative path for –directory,Makefile and buildenv.img at specified path
5,,,use elbe initvm create without any parameter,Makefile and buildenv.img at default locations
6,,build a customized initvm,"provide a XML file with a <initvm> description, that installs an additional package","specified package is installed in initvm, elbe daemon is running in initvm"
7,initvm start,start initvm,start initvm,can connect to elbe-daemon
8,initvm attach,get console at initvm,login with root:root,get login prompt and shell
9,initvm stop,stop initvm,stop initvm,"kvm process terminated, no connection to elbe-daemon"
10,initvm submit,work with absoulte paths,Build an example XML using absolute path for –directory and –output,"Elbe-project img, source and binary iso is valid and at the specified destination, project was deleted from initvm"
11,,work with relative paths,Build an example XML using relative path for –directory and –output,"Elbe-project img, source and binary iso is valid and at the specified destination, project was deleted from initvm"
12,,guess paths,Build an example XML using no path for –directory and –output,"Elbe-project img, source and binary iso is valid and at elbe-build-<timestamp>, project was deleted from initvm"
13,,keep projects in initvm,"Build an example XML using –directory, --skip-build-bin, --skip-build-sources, --skip-download –keep-files","Elbe-project img is valid and at elbe-build-<timestamp>, project is stored in initvm"
14,,all provided examples are functional,"Build an example XML using –directory, --skip-build-bin, --skip-build-sources","Elbe-project images are valid and at the specified destinations, projects are deleted from initvm"
15,,build from cdrom,elbe initvm submit binary-cdrom.iso,"Elbe initvm and project is generated from ISO image, created binary image is the same as the original image"
16,,build from source.xml,rebuild an image from a source.xml (with an updated package on the mirror),The updated package needs to be reported in validation.xml
17,,detect incomplete builds,build project with unavailable packages and finetuning rules that fail,error report should include informations about the failed build steps
18,,Repo key verification,URLs to repo keys provide a key that don't belong to the specified repository,error should be reported, also during 'initvm create'
19,initvm start_build,start build in background,start build in background and poll for termination using elbe control list_projects,build finishes and is stored in vm
20,,build invalid project (RFS doesn't fit in IMG),"start build in background, after termination get report from initvm",build state is failed and error report available
21,grub installation,grub is installed and working with debian kernel,Boot image produced by elbe-desktop.xml in kvm,ssh login is possible
22,,grub is installed and working with latest stable kernel,"use ellbe/contrib' patches on latest stable kernel, build debian package, specify package in XML (no debian kernel in XML), build XML",ssh login is possible
23,Repo key verification,noauth isnt set and no pubkey is provided,error should be detected in xml validation
24,modes,add tests for diet,tighten and setsel mode,for setsel also creating the xml file should be tested
