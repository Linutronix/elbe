## Dependencies

You need docker installed, a running docker service and `make` installed.


## usage

A `Makefile` with some handy targets are provided. Per default the image name
is `elbe-devel-image` and a started container name is `elbe-devel`. This names are
changeable via `IMAGENAME` and `CONTAINERNAME` environment variables.

* `build`: build the image
* `start` start a container, and use packaged
* `start-devel` start a container, mounts the elbe git-archive to `/usr/elbe`
* `stop`: stop a running container
* `stoprm`: stop and remove the container
* `connect`: attach a new terminal to a running container

After `connect` you can find the elbe git repository under `/elbe`.
